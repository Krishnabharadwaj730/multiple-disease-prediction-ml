# Multiple Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning algorithms to predict multiple diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and Parkinson’s disease based on patient data.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to assist in early diagnosis using user-inputted medical parameters. The application can be extended into a healthcare support system or integrated into health monitoring platforms.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Streamlit (for frontend UI)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine

## Features
- Input form for medical parameters
- Predict disease status (Yes/No) for:
  - Diabetes
  - Heart Disease
  - Parkinson’s Disease
- Streamlit-based web interface
